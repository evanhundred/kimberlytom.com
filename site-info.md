Cd ..INTRODUCTION

Would you like to feel more comfortable in your body? Would you like to reduce any pain you may have? Or would you like to improve your posture? Are you a little intimidated with the idea of yoga but would like to start? Consider a yoga class with emphasis on stretching and lengthening.

Kimberly takes the time to give you a private session(on Zoom or in person) to get to know your body and help teach you the poses in a way that works for your body and then the class can feel more comfortable. There is no charge for this session. The use of props such as bolsters, blocks, straps and blankets are used to make the poses attainable and relaxed for about a 30-60 seconds if desired.

Kimberly has group classes on Zoom and range from $10.00-25.00 per session. She also has in person sessions and are $65.00-110.00 per session.
